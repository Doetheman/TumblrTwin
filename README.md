Getting Started
Pair Programming: The checkpoints below should be implemented as pairs. In pair programming, there are two roles: navigator and driver.

Navigator: Makes the decision on what step to do next. Their job is to describe the step using high level language ("Let's print out something when the user is scrolling"). They also have a browser open in case they need to do any research.
Driver: is typing and their role is to translate the high level task into code ("Set the scroll view delegate, implement the didScroll method").
After you finish each checkpoint, switch the Navigator and Driver roles. The person on the right will be the first Navigator.
